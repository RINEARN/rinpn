# How to Create Assistant AIs

&raquo; [Japanese](./README_JAPANESE.md)

## Introduction

We have developed and made publicly available an assistant AI using ChatGPT's GPTs service that can help guide users of RINPn:

* [RINPn Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Hu225rEdv-rinpn-assistant)

As long as you have a ChatGPT account, you can access the above page and immediately start consulting with the AI.

However, due to your company's policies or the confidentiality of the information you handle, you might not be able to use the above assistant AI.
Even in such cases, if you have an internal AI system available, you may still be able to create an RINPn assistant AI by referring to the contents of this document.

The steps outlined in this document have been used to build and operate the RINPn Assistant mentioned above.

## Requirements

* LLM-based AI with RAG capabilities (e.g., GPTs on the ChatGPT service)

## Steps to Create

### Copying and Renaming Several Files

First, please copy and rename several files into this folder:

* ../plugin/org/vcssl/nano/plugin/system/README_ENGLISH.html -> ./System_Plugins_English.html
* ../plugin/org/vcssl/nano/plugin/system/README_JAPANESE.html -> ./System_Plugins_Japanese.html
* ../plugin/org/vcssl/nano/plugin/math/README_ENGLISH.html -> ./Math_Plugins_English.html
* ../plugin/org/vcssl/nano/plugin/math/README_JAPANESE.html -> ./Math_Plugins_Japanese.html

To execute this using commands, follow these steps:

    cd <this folder>
    cp ../plugin/org/vcssl/nano/plugin/system/README_ENGLISH.html ./System_Plugins_English.html
    cp ../plugin/org/vcssl/nano/plugin/system/README_JAPANESE.html ./System_Plugins_Japanese.html
    cp ../plugin/org/vcssl/nano/plugin/math/README_ENGLISH.html ./Math_Plugins_English.html
    cp ../plugin/org/vcssl/nano/plugin/math/README_JAPANESE.html ./Math_Plugins_Japanese.html

### Embedding Information into the RAG (Knowledge Search) System

The following files are originally user guides, but they are also very useful as "information sources for the AI to answer user questions":

* ../RINPn_User_Guide_English.html
* ../RINPn_User_Guide_Japanese.html

Therefore, please embed the above files into the AI's RAG (Knowledge Search) system. For example, with GPTs, upload them as "Knowledge" files.

Additionally, the following files should also be embedded. Depending on the user's questions, they may serve as useful references for the AI:

* Vnano_Syntax_Guide_English.json
* Vnano_Syntax_Guide_Japanese.json
* System_Plugins_English.html
* System_Plugins_Japanese.html
* Math_Plugins_English.html
* Math_Plugins_Japanese.html

### Create the Prompt

Next, create a custom prompt for your AI.

A template prompt is included in this folder as "InstructionToAI.txt":

    You are an operator responsible for guiding users on how to use the free scientific calculator 'RINPn,' which we developed. Thank you for your cooperation!

    ## Actions you are expected to perform:

    * Please answer in Japanese for questions asked in Japanese. For questions asked in English, respond in English. For questions in other languages, try to answer in the same language as the question whenever possible.

    * [!!!IMPORTANT!!!] Please refer to the "RINPn_User_Guide_Japanese.html" Knowledge file for questions in Japanese, and refer to the "RINPn_User_Guide_English.html" Knowledge file for questions in English to answer the user's queries.

    * When necessary, feel free to consult other Knowledge files as well.

    * If you cannot find the answer within the Knowledge files, please avoid making guesses and clearly state that you do not know the answer. In such cases, inform the user that they can contact RINEARN via the contact page (English: "https://www.rinearn.com/en-us/contact/", Japanese: "https://www.rinearn.com/ja-jp/contact/") for further assistance.

    * [!IMPORTANT!] Specifically, please avoid answering questions by guessing the functionality when the explanation cannot be found in the Knowledge files, as it may confuse the user and lead them to feel disappointed, thinking, "It would have been better not to ask at all." Be careful to avoid this.

    * At the end of your response, select and add a relevant hyperlink from the following list of web pages as a source for the information provided. This will serve as an important reference for users to investigate further. However, if the user's question is related to settings, please guide them to refer to the relevant sections in the Setting.txt file instead of adding a hyperlink to a web page.

Finally, register this prompt with your AI.

## Testing

To verify your AI is functioning correctly, ask questions like:

* What is RINPn?
* How do I use it?
* How do I define and use my own functions?

And other related queries.

Good lack!
